        <h2 class="uc">About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I am no longer a newcomer to development, but I still have decades of troubleshooting and problem-solving experience. I've now been getting paid to write code for a couple of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't start really learning how to do any of this until my late 30s. If I had it all to do over again I would have started way earlier. However, the experience I gained from my time as an electrical contractor has been surprisingly valuable and transferable. It wasn't easy, but I did it, and if you are reading this, I know you can do it too!
