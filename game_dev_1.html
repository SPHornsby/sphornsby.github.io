            When I was a kid, my brother and I would take turns sitting in front of our Atari 800XL, copying BASIC code from magazines Analog and Antic. Games like <span class="italics">Adventure at Vandenberg A.F.B.</span> A lot has changed since then, but that type of experimenting is still quite possible.

            Development in general is a vast landscape, and narrowing it down into game development for the web still leaves pretty big horizons. 
            So lets zoom in from general development, to web development, to web game development, all the way down to 2D web game development. This is the perfect place to start learning. In this space, there are several big contenders: <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity">Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2">Construct2</a>, <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, and <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/">Cocos2d</a>. All of these options have free versions that are robust enough to use at the hobby level.
          </p>
          <p>
            These can be (roughly) divided into frameworks and toolsets. Frameworks keep you working at a code level, while toolsets provide an environment for you to work in. Unity, Cocos2D and Construct2 are toolsets, and use well-built GUIs. For my purposes here, I find that level of abstraction to be distracting. I like working on the code directly, an Phaser offers exactly that experience. Phaser is simple enough, I get to do all the work in my IDE, but it handles the canvas gruntwork, leaving me free to tinker.

            Now that I have selected an engine, I have to decide what to do with it. Maybe you already have an idea for a game, I have several myself, but I am learning that simpler is always better. Always. So give your idea a long, hard look and compare it to the simplest of classics like Pong, Breakout, maybe Space Invaders. Unless it is that simple, consider doing one of two things. Pull out the simplest concepts and make that first, or, since the leg work is already done, just remake a classic. Any of those I listed above would be great, but there are many, many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not always great at following my own advice, but this time I managed to hold firm. Because there are many lessons to learn, I plan on remaking several of the classics, starting with Pong.
