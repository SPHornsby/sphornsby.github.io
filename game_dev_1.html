            When I was a kid, my brother and I would take turns sitting in front of our Atari 800XL, copying BASIC code from magazines Analog and Antic. Games like <span class="italics">Adventure at Vandenberg A.F.B.</span> A lot has changed since then, but that type of experimenting is still quite possible.

            Development in general is a vast landscape, and narrowing it down into game development for the web still leaves pretty big horizons. On that scale there are two basic branches: 3D and 2D games. This article is going to focus on 2D, but I will briefly mention that if you are intereted in 3D, <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity">Unity</a> is the place to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here we are, we've zoomed in from general development, to web development, to web game development, all the way down to 2D web game development, and we're still in a pretty big field. In this space, there are three big contenders: <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2">Construct2</a>, <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, and <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/">Cocos2d</a>. The big 3D engine, Unity, also does 2D, quite well. If you are searching for something a little less hefty, there is <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js">PixiJS</a> (which is what Phaser is built on top of). The lightest weight solution, of course, is to use JavaScript's canvas element. MDN has a great tutorial for that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these options have free versions that are robust enough to use at the hobby level. Any of them would make a good choice to jump into. I chose Phaser because I like working on the code. Cocos2D and Construct both utilize a GUI abstraction that I find distracting. Phaser is simple enough, I get to do all the work in my IDE, but it handles the canvas gruntwork, leaving me free to tinker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I have selected an engine, I have to decide what to do with it. Maybe you already have an idea for a game, I have several myself, but I am learning that simpler is always better. Always. So give your idea a long, hard look and compare it to the simplest of classics like Pong, Breakout, maybe Space Invaders. Unless it is that simple, consider one of two things. Pull out the simplest concepts and make that first, or, since the leg work is already done, just remake a classic. Any of those I listed above would be great, but there are many, many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not always great at following my own advice, but this time I managed to hold firm. Because there are many lessons to learn, I plan on remaking several of the classics, starting with Pong. You can follow along with my journey <a href="">here</a>.
