        <article>
          <p>
            This is an introduction to game development, using JavaScript and HTML5. I am using the Phaser framework, which is built on top of Pixi.js. You can download Phaser <a href="https://phaser.io/">here</a>, the documentation is <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building a game with Phaser requires very little setup. First I write a bare bones html page. It has two jobs. It pulls in the Phaser code from a CDN, and it has a spot for the game to live. I use a named div as the target, but if there is nowhere else for it to go, Phaser will just drop it into the body. From there it is on to the meat, the JavaScript file.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Phaser JavaScript file can roughly be broken down into six parts. At the top of the file is the game declaration.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  const game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, 'pg', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update }); 
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Inside the declaration are several parameters. Working from left to right they are: game width, game height, game type (WebGL/Canvas/Auto), the html attachment point (optional), and an initialization object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of the game is the initialization of your game objects. The globals that get handled by the game code. Here you will typically see player and enemy objects, groups, score, sounds, any terrain that can be interacted with, etc.
          </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  let player;
  let c_player;
  let ball;
  let cursors;
  let p_score = 0;
  let p_scoreText;
  ...
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            Next up are the core components of a Phaser game. Preload is where all the assets are loaded into the game (for use later in Create and Update). Things like sprites, images, and sounds are all aliased here. You can tell you are in the Preloader by the heavy use of game.load.
          </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function preload () {
    game.load.audio('p_hit_1', './sounds/paddle_hit.wav');
    game.load.audio('p_hit_2', './sounds/paddle_hit_2.wav');
    game.load.audio('wall_hit', './sounds/wall_hit.wav');
  }
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            Create does exactly that. It creates the game state and puts everything in place for the game to run. Those background images and player sprites you set up in Preload are attached to Phaser objects here using game.add. 
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function create () {
    //player
    player = game.add.graphics (40, 270);
    player.beginFill(0xFFFFFF, 1);
    player.drawRect(0,0,10,60);
    game.physics.arcade.enable(player);
    player.body.collideWorldBounds = true;
    ...
    // sounds
    paddle_hit_1 = game.add.audio('p_hit_1');
    paddle_hit_2 = game.add.audio('p_hit_2');
    wall_hit = game.add.audio('wall_hit');
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            There is a lot going on in 5 lines of code, so I'll break it down. The first three lines create a player at a certain point of the game, set its color to opaque white, and set its shape. The fourth line is the big one. Phaser bundles a whole lot of work into that one line. Anything worth doing with Phaser's game objects will likely require a physics model. The arcade physics gives us access to positioning and movement via the body property. Line five uses that to keep the player bound inside the game. Another piece of code that will come in handy later is the cursors assignment.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function create () {
    ...
    // controls
    cursors = game.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Put simply, Phaser allows us to quickly assign common movement keys. We'll use those in the Update function very soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preload and Create run once. Update, on the other hand, runs every frame, it is your classic game loop. Because of this, it is the home for the game logic. Things like checking for conditions and performing actions based on those conditions. Updating score, player health, movement, timers, etc.
          </p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <h3>Philosophical Interlude</h3>
            <p>
              One of the hardest things for me to learn has been keeping things simple. In my head, I always thought I was distilling down to essentials, but what I was really doing was convincing myself that it was 'simple enough.' That's not simple though, and sometimes it is pretty far from simple. Any project will have multiple concepts to deal with, and the best thing to do is take them one at a time. One. Not a few related concepts bundled into one. One. Concept. At. A. Time.
            </p>
            <p>
              A very simple first Phaser game will certainly have several game logic concepts. It is tempting to look at the end result, see how simple it is, and think you can handle it all as a chunk. I would suggest listing out each concept.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collision</li>
              <li>Movement</li>
              <li>Scorekeeping</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Even a straightforward game will very quickly need other concepts too. Things like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>AI</li>
              <li>Group Logic</li>
              <li>Conditionals</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            All of this comes together in the Update section. Update runs every frame, so it s the place to deal with anything that is expected to change. Any collisions, movement, scorekeeping,... anything from the lists we made above, happens here. The first item on the list is collision, and Phaser has thoughfully provided us two methods to handle collision: collide, and overlap. Collide will automatically separate the colliding objects, while overlap will not. Since I want to tell the objects what to do when they hit each other, I am going to use overlap. 
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function update () {
    // collision
    game.physics.arcade.overlap(ball, player, reflect);
    game.physics.arcade.overlap(ball, c_player, reflect);
    ...
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Overlap is called with up to five parameters, only the first two of which are necessary. They are: object1, object2, overlapCallback, processCallback, and callbackContext. In this case, I have no need for the processCallback or callbackContext. I give overlap the two objects and a function to run if they overlap. Here is what that looks like in its simplest form:
          </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function reflect(ball, actor) {
    ball.body.velocity.x *= -1;
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            So, if the ball and the player (or c_player) overlap, reflect reverses the horizontal velocity. It can (and will) get more complex as our game gets more complex, but for now, that will do just fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember way back in create when we assigned createCursorKeys() to cursors? That is a tidy little Phaser that binds the arrow keys as up, down, left, and right. Now, they are available to us inside update (and actually anywhere else in the game because of where we declared cursors).
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  // controls
  player.body.velocity.y = 0;
  if (cursors.up.isDown) {
    //  Move up
    player.body.velocity.y = -250;
  }
  else if (cursors.down.isDown) {
    //  Move down
    player.body.velocity.y = 250;
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Scorekeeping comes in a lot of forms. Sometimes it is displayed during the whole game, other times just at the end, or maybe never. What this tells me is that keeping score and showing the score are separate responsibilities. Since they are closely related, we can tackle them back to back here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping score is fairly easy. Declare global score variable, and then increment (or decrement, or reset or whatever), anywhere that the game calls for it.
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function update () {
    ...
    // ball is out
    if (ball.body.x <= 0) {
      p_score++;
    }
    ...
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            The score display needs to be added to the game as a text element. That is accomplished with a Phaser game.add.text The format should look familiar. X coordinate, y coordinate, and value, followed by a style object (that's just good old CSS).
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  // scores
  p_scoreText = game.add.text(320, 16, '0', { font: 'Courier', fontSize: '40px', fill: '#fff' });
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Now that score is being tracked and a display object exists, we can update the score when necessary. How about every time update runs?
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint"><code>
  function update () {
    ...
    p_scoreText.text = p_score;
    ...
  }
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            That is a lot to chew on, but it is also enough to make a simple game. In the next installment, that is exactly what I plan to do. The classic game Pong will bring all of these concepts, and a few more, together in one place. <a href="https://sphornsby.github.io/game_dev_3.html">Follow along here!</a>
